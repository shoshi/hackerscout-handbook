The Hackerscout Handbook
========================

The coder's guide to community building.

## Getting Started:

This site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), because it's awesome.
To get setup with Jekyll, head on over to the
[github page](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to install the gem and read up
on the documentation. It's simple, I promise. Then, you should be good to go!

Run the server with: `jekyll serve --baseurl ''`

To contribute, fork and pull request to your heart's content. Also, feel free
to open any "issues" for page requests, other info you think we should include,
and necessary bugs to squash.

## Adding New Pages:

1. Does the page fit into an existing category? If so, go to step 2. If not,
   add a new folder for that category in the root folder. Folder names should be
   hyphenated, just for consistency.
2. Add a new page in the appropriate folder. Page file names should be
   hyphenated, again for consistency. Pages can be written in markdown or
   regular-type HTML. Add a heading to the file like so and type away:

   ```
    ---
    layout: default
    title: YOUR PAGE TITLE GOES HERE
    ---
   ```

3. Open `index.html` and add a link back to the page you just created under the
   appropriate category. File types are stripped in routing, so a link to the
   page should look like `/category/page-name/`. If you've created a new
   category, first add a `<h2>` with the category name and a `<ul>` for pages.
   This page functions as our *Table of Contents*.
4. That's it! Submit a pull request and give yourself some karma points.
